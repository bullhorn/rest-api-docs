Retrieves a list of entities. The search call is performed against a optimized index, therefore the query parameter should reflect Lucene Query Syntax. For information about the Lucene query syntax, see: [Lucene Tutorial](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html)

<aside class="notice">If you provide no request parameters, a list of available search fields are provided.</aside>

Note that the response contains a _score field. This is the Lucene score. Also, if the database record for an entity id is missing, the response contains an _error field for that record.

<aside class="notice">If parameter "fields" or "layout" is not present, the search will return the list of found entity ids in the returned "data".</aside>

``` shell
curl https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/search/Candidate?query=isDeleted:0

# Example Response
{
    "data": [101,102,103,104,...,999]
}
```

Gets one or more entities or to-many associations.

Individual entity records are manifested as resources, where the entity type and id form the last two parts of the resource path.

Specify the fields to be included in the response using the `fields` request parameters. The `id` field is always returned, regardless of the fields requested. See for more detail on specifying fields.

NOTE: At least one of the required parameters(fields and layout) or both must be specified.

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}/{entityId}?fields={fieldList}`

Param | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
fields | yes | Comma-separated list of field names. fields or layout is required.
layout | yes | Name of a configured layout. fields or layout is required.
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.
meta | no | off, basic, or full. Default is off (no meta). Returns metadata that describes the structure of returned entity data. For more information, see [Meta](#meta).
showEditable | no | (true/false) Default value is false. Whether to show the _editable field in responses. The _editable field indicates whether an entity is editable. Setting showEditable to true results in slower performance; use this setting sparingly and only when needed.

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 error if the requested entity cannot be found.</aside>

## Multiple Entities

``` shell
curl https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/Candidate/123,456?fields=id,firstName,lastName

# Example Response
{
    data: [
        {
          "id" : 123,
          "firstName" : "Alanzo",
          "lastName" : "Smith"
        }, {

          "firstName" : "Janis",
          "lastName" : "Williams"
        }
    ]
}
```

This is an extension of the single GET and supports the same result set control parameters (count, start) as the query call. Id values are specified as a comma-separated list:

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}/{{entity-id},{entity-id},*}?fields={field-list}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
fields | yes | Comma-separated list of field names.

## <span class="tag">PUT</span> /entity

``` shell
curl -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"firstName" : "Alanzo", "lastName" : "Smith"}' \
     https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/Candidate

# Example Response
{
  "changedEntityId": 1489,
  "changeType": "INSERT"
}

```

You can use HTTP PUT requests to create new entities. The URL looks the same as GET request URL, but without the last path element containing an entity ID. Place the data comprising the new entity to be inserted in JSON format in the request body. The structure of the JSON is identical to that returned in HTTP responses to GET requests, with a few additional restrictions:

*   You cannot create to-many associations on the entity being inserted. You must create them in a subsequent "associate" call.
*   You can create to-one associations. The associations can only be to existing entities; You cannot create new associated entities while creating the main entity.

Associations fields are set by giving as their values a JSON object containing one field, named 'id', and having value the id of the entity to associate.

If you specify fields that do not exist on the entity being created, returns a 400 error containing messaging about the unknown fields,

Most entities in the Bullhorn data model contains mandatory fields. Some of these mandatory fields have default values. All mandatory fields without default values must have values specified in the JSON body of the PUT request or returns a 400 error.

NOTE: When using an HTTP PUT request to create a Client Corporation entity an archived Client Contact entity, which belongs to this new Client Corporation, will automatically be created. This mirrors what is done through the ATS when creating a Client Corporation and allows the new Client Corporation to correctly follow ownership rules (where the ownership of a Client Corp is based on ownership of its Client Contacts) and belong to the person creating it.Â 

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 error if the requested entity cannot be found, if fields are specified that do not exist on the specified entity, or if values for any mandatory fields with no default value are not included.</aside>


### Create To-many Associations

``` shell
curl -X PUT \
     https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/Candidate/3084/primarySkills/964,684,253
```

You can add to-many associations to an entity with a PUT request in which you specify entity IDs of the entities you want to associate. The call fails if any of the association entities you specify are already associated.

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}/{entity-id}/{to-many-association-name}/{entity-id},*}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.

<aside class="warning">Returns An HTTP 404 error if the requested entity cannot be found, fields are specified that do not exist on the specified entity, or you specify values for any mandatory fields with no default values.</aside>

## <span class="tag">POST</span> /entity

``` shell
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "id" : 5059165, "firstName" : "Alanzo","lastName" : "Smith" }' \
     https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/Candidate/5059165

     # Example Response
{
  "changedEntityId": 1489,
  "changeType": "UPDATE"
}
```
You can update entities with HTTP POST requests. The URL looks the same as the GET request URL. Place the data comprising the entity fields in JSON format in the request body. The structure of the JSON in a POST request is identical to that returned in HTTP responses to GET requests, but read-only properties cannot be changed.

<aside class="notice">To update confidential fields as part of a POST /entity call, the user must have the Edit Confidential Data user action entitlement. The confidentialFieldList private label attribute contains the list of fields that are considered confidential.</aside>

*   You cannot create to-many associations on the entity being updated. You must create to-many associations in a subsequent "associate" call.
*   You can create to-one associations.

You set association fields by giving as their values a JSON object that contains a field named 'id', and providing the value the id of the entity to associate.

If you provide fields that do not exist on the entity being created, returns a 400 error containing messages about the unknown fields.

Most entities in the Bullhorn data model contain mandatory fields, some of which have default values. Returns a 400 error if you do not specify, in the JSON body of the PUT request, values for all mandatory fields that do not have default values.

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 if the requested entity cannot be found, if fields are specified that do not exist on the specified entity, or if values for any mandatory fields with no default value are not included.</aside>


### To-many Associations - Special Case

``` shell
# This example will create and associate a new customObject1s record.
curl -X PUT https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/JobOrder/123

# This example will update an existing customObject1s record #1.
curl -X PUT https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/JobOrder/123
```

For special to-many associations, like Custom Objects, we have the ability to create and associate in a single step. Â These is due to the fact that we need to know their context to enforce security and data integrity. Â You can add/update to-many associations with a POST request the same as if it was data directly on the parent entity. You can combine standard parent entity updates with special association add and edits.

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/entity/{parent-entity-name}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 if the requested entity cannot be found, if fields are specified that do not exist on the specified entity, or if values for any mandatory fields with no default value are not included.</aside>


## <span class="tag">DELETE</span> /entity

Deletes an entity or to-many association.

The API supports two types of delete requests:
* Hard or soft delete using the DELETE verb
* Soft delete using the POST verb.

### Hard or Soft Delete via DELETE call

``` shell
curl -X DELETE \
     https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/NoteEntity/2552
```

Hard deletes a hard-deletable entity, which removes it from the database. Soft deletes a soft-deletable entity, which sets the isDeleted property of the entity to true.

This operation is available for all entity types except immutable entities, which are neither hard-deletable or soft-deletable. Immutable entities include the following:

*   BusinessSector
*   Category
*   Country
*   Skill
*   Specialty
*   State
*   TimeUnit

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}/{entity-id}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 error if the requested entity cannot be found.</aside>

To delete an entity with children, explicitly delete all the children before attempting to delete the root entity.

### Soft delete via POST (update) call

``` shell
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "isDeleted" : true }' \
     https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/ClientContact/1804

```

When you soft delete an entity, it is not removed from the database. A soft delete operation is actually an update (for example, POST) that sets the isDeleted property of the entity to true.

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}/{entity-id}`

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 error if the requested entity cannot be found.</aside>

### Disassociate To-many Associations

``` shell
curl -X DELETE \
     https://rest.bullhornstaffing.com/rest-services/e999/entity/Candidate/3084/primarySkills/253
```

Removes or "disassociates" a to-many association relationship on an entity.

`{corpToken}/entity/{entityType}/{entity-id}/{to-many-association-name}/{entity-id},*}`

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 error if the requested entity cannot be found.</aside>

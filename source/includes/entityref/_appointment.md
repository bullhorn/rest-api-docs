# Appointment

Represents an appointment on a Bullhorn user's calendar. A separate Appointment instance is created for each user who is invited to the appointment; the instance belonging to the Appointment owner (the person who created it) is the parent, and has a null value for the parentAppointment property. The Appointment instances belonging to the invitees are the child instances; these refer to the parent in their parentAppointment properties, and are associated with the parent through its childAppointments association. Each user who is invited to the appointment is represented by an AppointmentAttendee instance.

# NoteEntity

Represents the Candidate, ClientContact, CorporateUser, JobOrder, or Placement associated with a Note.

If you include a commentingPerson value and a personReference value when you create a Note, the association to an entity is made automatically and you do not need to make a separate call to create a NoteEntity.

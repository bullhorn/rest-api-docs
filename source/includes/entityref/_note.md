# Note

Represents a note (comment) associated with a Candidate, ClientContact, CorporateUser, JobOrder, Lead, or Opportunity. Notes can be accessed via the "Notes" tab on the person's record in the Bullhorn application.

If you include a commentingPerson value and a personReference value when you create a Note, the association to an entity is made automatically and you do not need to make a separate call to create a NoteEntity.

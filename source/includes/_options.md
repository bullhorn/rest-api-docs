Gets the list of value/label pairs (options) for a list-based entity. If the option is of type text, a list of input value/label pairs is returned where the label is set to the input value.

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/options//{optionType}`

or:

`{corpToken}/options//{optionType}/value1,*}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
filter | no | Filter on the label, prefix with an asterisk (*)  to find word begins. For example, filter=foo returns all options where label starts with "foo", such as "Fool". filter=*foo returns all options where any word in the label starts with "foo", such as "A Fool". Some labels are composed of two or more parts. For example, a name is composed of firstname and lastname separated by a space. In these cases, filtering is based on each part of the label. For example, filter=Ba, will find any part of a label that starts with Ba. Therefore, the results could include "Bailey Hutchinson" as well as "Sam Bailey".
type-specific parameters | no | Some option types accept additional parameters. For example, State has an optional "country" parameter. 
count | no | Limit on the number of entities to return. If the set of matched results is larger than count, caps the returned results at size count. The default count is 20. The maximum count is 300; if you specify a count greater than 300, a message at the end of the response indicates you have specified too many items.
start | no | From the set of matched results, return item numbers start through (start + count).
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.

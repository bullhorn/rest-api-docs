## About Cluster IDs

CLS2, CLS21 etc. are cluster IDs that are contained in a userâ€™s browser URL (address bar) once they are logged in.

Example: https://cls21.bullhornstaffing.com/BullhornSTAFFING/MainFrame.jsp?#no-ba... indicates that the logged in user is on CLS21 (therefore the appropriate API URLs to use are for the UK Data Center)
As such Cluster IDs do not change for a customer, so identifying the correct cluster ID for all users for a given customer is a one time exercise.
